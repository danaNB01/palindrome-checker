# palindrome-checker
My first real JavaScript project â€” finally moving past the classic alert('you clicked the button') phase ðŸ™ƒ. This responsive app checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. It's just the beginning of my journey through the freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum, so stay tunedâ€”thereâ€™s a lot more to come!âœ¨
